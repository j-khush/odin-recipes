The Odin Project- Recipes

The Odin Project has helped me learn web development from the grassroot level. Along with web development, I have learnt a lot of other important skills, like how one  should communicate, ask for help, what the internet and the web is, what is the difference between various image formats, how to write a good git commit message, what the command lone is and how it is used, and all the basics of html, and there is still so much more to learn. I am sure I will learn a lot more along the way.
